# Current Feature: Email Verification Feature Flag

## Status

In Progress

## Goals

- One env variable, `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED`, controls whether new users must verify their email before signing in
- When `true` (default): existing flow — token issued, email sent via Resend, user lands on `/verify-email`, credentials sign-in blocked until verified
- When `false`: skip Resend entirely on register, auto-set `User.emailVerified` to "now" on user creation, redirect register flow straight to `/sign-in?registered=1`, and credentials `authorize` does not enforce the `emailVerified` check
- Toggle requires only an env var change + restart — no code or DB changes
- Existing users (verified or not) keep working under both modes

## Notes

- **Single source of truth:** centralize the flag in `src/lib/config.ts` (or similar) so callsites read `isEmailVerificationEnabled()` instead of touching `process.env` directly. Easier to grep, easier to test, easier to swap later (e.g., DB-backed or per-env).
- **Default:** `true` (verification ON) when env var is unset or unrecognized — fail-closed against accidental misconfig in production. User will set `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED=false` locally for now.
- **Parsing:** treat `"true"`, `"1"`, `"yes"` (case-insensitive) as enabled; anything else off-only when explicitly set to `"false"`/`"0"`/`"no"`. Keep parser narrow.
- **Affected callsites:**
  - `POST /api/auth/register`: when disabled, `emailVerified: new Date()` on create, skip `createVerificationToken` + `sendVerificationEmail`, return success — register form still redirects (we'll either keep `/verify-email` redirect with a "verification disabled — sign in" copy, or change register-form to redirect to `/sign-in` when disabled by reading a flag from the server response). Decide during implementation; simplest: server returns `{ verificationRequired: boolean }` and register form branches on it.
  - `src/auth.ts` credentials `authorize`: when disabled, skip the `if (!user.emailVerified) return null` check.
  - `POST /api/auth/resend-verification`: when disabled, return generic OK without sending (avoids leaking flag state).
  - `GET /api/auth/verify`: leave as-is (idempotent, harmless if toggled).
- **Document** the new env var in `.env.example` next to `RESEND_API_KEY`/`EMAIL_FROM` with a one-line comment explaining the use case (no verified Resend domain yet).
- **Do not delete** `RESEND_API_KEY` / verification code — flag is a runtime switch, not a removal.

- Recent collections grid with favorite indicator and item count
- Pinned items section (conditional — renders only when pinned items exist)
- 10 most recent items grid with type icon/color, description, code preview, and tags
- Added shadcn Card and Badge components

### 2026-05-05 — Prisma + Neon PostgreSQL Setup
- Installed Prisma 7, `@prisma/adapter-pg`, `pg`, `dotenv`, `tsx`
- Created `prisma/schema.prisma` with Prisma 7 generator (`prisma-client`, mandatory output) and full schema: User, Item, ItemType, Collection, ItemCollection, Tag, and NextAuth models
- Created `prisma.config.ts` with datasource URL, migrations path, and seed command (Prisma 7 pattern)
- Created `src/lib/prisma.ts` singleton using `PrismaPg` driver adapter (required in Prisma 7)
- Created `prisma/seed.ts` to seed 7 system item types
- Created migration `20260505160854_init` and applied to Neon dev branch
- Seeded system item types successfully

### 2026-05-05 — Seed Data
- Installed bcryptjs for password hashing
- Rewrote prisma/seed.ts with demo user (demo@devstash.io, bcrypt 12 rounds) and 5 collections
- React Patterns: 3 TypeScript snippets (useDebounce, Context provider, utility functions)
- AI Workflows: 3 prompts (code review, documentation generator, refactoring assistant)
- DevOps: 1 snippet (Dockerfile), 1 command (deploy chain), 2 links (Docker, GitHub Actions)
- Terminal Commands: 4 commands (git, docker, process management, npm utilities)
- Design Resources: 4 links (Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Lucide)
- Seed is idempotent — cleans demo user data before recreating

### 2026-05-06 — Dashboard Collections — Real Data
- Created `src/lib/db/collections.ts` with `getRecentCollections()` and `getCollectionStats()`
- `getRecentCollections()` fetches 6 most recent collections with items and types included, computes dominant type color and unique type icons per collection
- Dashboard page made async server component with `force-dynamic` to prevent stale static caching
- CollectionCard updated with colored `border-l-[3px]` from dominant type and small type icons in card footer
- Collections and Favorite Collections stat cards now use real DB counts

### 2026-05-06 — Dashboard Items — Real Data
- Created `src/lib/db/items.ts` with `getPinnedItems()`, `getRecentItems()`, and `getItemStats()`
- All three functions scope to the demo user and include `itemType` and `tags` relations
- Dashboard page now fetches all five data sources in parallel via `Promise.all`
- Removed `mockItems` dependency from dashboard page; Total Items and Favorite Items stats now use real DB counts
- `ItemCard` component updated to accept `ItemWithMeta` type (tags as `string[]`)

### 2026-05-06 — Stats & Sidebar — Real Data
- Added `getSidebarCollections()` to `src/lib/db/collections.ts` — returns collections with `dominantColor` from most-used item type
- Added `getSystemItemTypes()` to `src/lib/db/items.ts` — fetches system types in display order with per-type item counts via `groupBy`
- Converted `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` to async server component; fetches item types + sidebar collections in parallel and passes as props
- Updated `DashboardLayout` to accept and forward `itemTypes` and `collections` props to both desktop and mobile `SidebarNav`
- Replaced `mockItemTypes` and `mockCollections` in `SidebarNav` with real props
- Recent collections show a colored circle (dominant type color) instead of a clock icon
- Each item type in the sidebar shows its item count on the right
- Restored Favorites quick-access link in the sidebar
- Added "View all collections →" link below the sidebar collections list

### 2026-05-06 — Component Extraction + Code Quality Quick Wins
- Moved shared `ICON_MAP` constant to `src/lib/constants/item-types.ts` — removed duplication from `page.tsx` and `sidebar-nav.tsx`
- Extracted `SectionHeading` → `src/components/shared/section-heading.tsx`
- Extracted `ItemCard` → `src/components/items/item-card.tsx`
- Extracted `CollectionCard` → `src/components/collections/collection-card.tsx`
- Fixed `ml-auto` collision in `ItemCard` — Star + Pin icons now share a single `ml-auto` wrapper so they render side-by-side correctly when an item is both favorited and pinned
- `dashboard/page.tsx` reduced from 200 lines to 70 — now only data-fetching and layout

### 2026-05-06 — Pro Badge in Sidebar + Header Buttons
- Added `isPro` prop to `NavItem` in `sidebar-nav.tsx`; renders a subtle shadcn `Badge` (secondary, dimmed) with uppercase "PRO" text next to Files and Images types
- Fixed Collections toggle: added `type="button"` and functional updater to resolve collapse not toggling on click
- Added "New Collection" outline button to the dashboard header alongside the existing "New Item" button

### 2026-05-08 — Auth Setup: NextAuth v5 + GitHub OAuth
- Installed `next-auth@5.0.0-beta.31` and `@auth/prisma-adapter@2.11.2`
- Split auth config: `src/auth.config.ts` (edge-safe, GitHub provider + `authorized` callback) and `src/auth.ts` (Prisma adapter + JWT strategy + `jwt`/`session` callbacks injecting `user.id`)
- Created API route handler at `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` re-exporting `GET`/`POST` from `handlers`
- Created `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 proxy) — named `proxy = auth` export, matcher locked to `/dashboard/:path*`; unauthenticated users redirected to NextAuth's default sign-in page
- Extended `Session.user` with `id: string` and JWT with `id?: string` via module augmentation in `src/types/next-auth.d.ts`
- Added `.env.example` and a `!.env.example` exception in `.gitignore`

### 2026-05-08 — Auth Phase 2: Credentials Provider + Register API
- Added `Credentials` provider placeholder to `src/auth.config.ts` (edge-safe, `authorize: async () => null`) so the proxy/edge bundle stays bcrypt/Prisma-free
- Overrode `Credentials` in `src/auth.ts`: filters the placeholder out of `authConfig.providers` and re-registers with real `authorize` — lowercase/trim email, `prisma.user.findUnique`, `bcrypt.compare`, returns `{ id, email, name, image }`
- Created `POST /api/auth/register` at `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` — validates name/email/password/confirmPassword (regex email, ≥8 chars, match check), 409 on duplicate email, hashes with `bcrypt.hash(password, 12)`, returns `{ user: { id, email, name } }` on 201
- No DB migration needed — `User.password String?` already existed in schema
- Verified: `/api/auth/providers` lists both `github` and `credentials`; sign-in via `/api/auth/callback/credentials` issues `authjs.session-token` with `user.id`; `/dashboard` returns 200 with cookie; wrong password yields null session; all validation paths (duplicate, mismatch, short pw, missing field, bad email) return correct errors

### 2026-05-08 — Auth Phase 3: Custom Auth UI + Sidebar User Menu + Toasts
- Wired `pages.signIn = "/sign-in"` in `src/auth.config.ts` so the proxy and `auth()` redirects target the custom dark page (no more default white NextAuth page)
- Built `/sign-in`, `/register`, `/profile` as server components with `force-dynamic`; each calls `auth()` and redirects authed (sign-in/register) or unauthed (profile) users
- Extracted client form components: `src/components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx` (credentials + inline GitHub brand SVG since lucide-react dropped `Github`; uses `signIn` from `next-auth/react`) and `src/components/auth/register-form.tsx` (validation, `POST /api/auth/register`, redirects to `/sign-in?registered=1`)
- Added reusable `UserAvatar` (`src/components/shared/user-avatar.tsx`) with `getInitials()` helper at `src/lib/initials.ts` — image-or-initials fallback, "Brad Traversy" → "BT"
- Added `UserMenu` (`src/components/layout/user-menu.tsx`) — sidebar bottom area with avatar linking to `/profile`, chevron-toggled upward popover (Profile + Sign out), pointerdown-outside + Escape close
- Removed `mockUser` from `SidebarNav`; `dashboard/layout.tsx` calls `auth()` and forwards real `user` through `DashboardLayout` to both desktop and mobile `SidebarNav`
- Installed `sonner` and added `<Toaster theme="dark" position="top-right" richColors closeButton />` to root layout
- Toasts: sign-in success "Welcome back!", sign-in failure "Invalid email or password", register validation/server errors, and one-shot "Account created — sign in to continue" on `/sign-in?registered=1` (deduped via stable `id: "registered"` to survive React StrictMode double-effect)
- All four auth-adjacent pages render dynamically; smoke-tested HTTP: `/sign-in` 200, `/register` 200, `/dashboard` and `/profile` redirect to `/sign-in?callbackUrl=...` when unauthed, `/sign-in` redirects to `/dashboard` when authed

### 2026-05-08 — Email Verification on Register (Resend)
- Installed `resend@6.12.3`; added `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `APP_URL` to `.env.example`
- `src/lib/email/resend.ts` — Resend client + `sendVerificationEmail()` (HTML + text), default sender `DevStash <onboarding@resend.dev>` overridable via `EMAIL_FROM`
- `src/lib/auth/verification-token.ts` — `createVerificationToken`, `consumeVerificationToken`, `canResendVerification`. Tokens are 32 random bytes, **stored as sha256 hashes** in `VerificationToken.token` (no schema change), single-use, 24h TTL, 60s resend cooldown
- `POST /api/auth/register` — issues token + sends verification email after user creation; failures logged but don't block registration; redirects user to `/verify-email?email=<email>`
- `GET /api/auth/verify?token=...` — consumes token, sets `User.emailVerified`, redirects to `/sign-in?verify=success|expired|invalid`
- `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` — generic-OK responses for non-existent/already-verified emails (no enumeration), 429 on cooldown
- `src/auth.ts` credentials `authorize` — returns `null` when `emailVerified === null` (GitHub OAuth path untouched; Auth.js sets `emailVerified` automatically for OAuth)
- New `/verify-email` page (`src/app/verify-email/page.tsx` + `src/components/auth/verify-email-card.tsx`) — "Check your email" card showing the user's address with mail icon, "Resend verification email" button, and "Sign in" link; redirects to `/dashboard` if already authed
- Sign-in form: refs + `autoComplete="off"` on form + `autoComplete="new-password"` on password + 50ms post-mount DOM `.value` clear to defeat browser autofill on every visit; toasts on `?verify=success|expired|invalid`
- Demo user (`demo@devstash.io`) already seeded with `emailVerified: new Date()` so credentials sign-in still works
- Added `scripts/purge-non-demo-users.ts` — destructive script to delete all non-demo users + their cascading data; dry-run by default, `--yes` flag required to actually delete; refuses to run if demo user is missing

### 2026-05-08 — Email Verification Feature Flag
- Added `src/lib/config.ts` with `isEmailVerificationEnabled()` — single source of truth that reads `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED`. Narrow parser: `true|1|yes` → enabled, `false|0|no` → disabled, anything else → default. Default is `true` (fail-closed); `server-only`
- `.env.example` documents the new var alongside Resend config
- `POST /api/auth/register` branches on the flag — when disabled, sets `emailVerified: new Date()` on user create, skips token issuance + email send. Always returns `{ user, verificationRequired }` so the client can route correctly
- `register-form.tsx` reads `verificationRequired` from the response: `/verify-email?email=…` when true, `/sign-in?registered=1` when false
- `sign-in-form.tsx` — restored the `?registered=1` "Account created — sign in to continue" toast for the disabled-flag flow (the `?verify=*` toasts remain)
- `src/auth.ts` credentials `authorize` — `emailVerified` check now gated behind `isEmailVerificationEnabled()`, so existing unverified users can sign in immediately when the flag is flipped off
- `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` — short-circuits to generic `{ ok: true }` when the flag is disabled, so the endpoint reveals nothing about the flag's state
- No code/DB changes required to flip — set `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED=false` in `.env` and restart. Resend stays in the codebase as a runtime switch, not a removal
