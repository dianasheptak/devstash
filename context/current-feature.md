<!-- Feature Name -->

## Prisma + Neon PostgreSQL Setup

## Status

<!-- Not Started|In Progress|Completed -->

Completed

## Goals

<!-- Goals & requirements -->

- Set up Prisma 7 ORM with Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- Create initial schema based on data models in `context/project-overview.md`
- Include NextAuth models (Account, Session, VerificationToken)
- Add appropriate indexes and cascade deletes
- Create migration (never push directly to the database)
- Seed system item types

## Notes

<!-- Any extra notes -->

Reference: @context/features/database-spec.md

- Always use `prisma migrate dev` for development migrations — never `prisma db push`
- Prisma 7 has breaking changes — read the upgrade guide before implementing
- Dev database uses `DATABASE_URL`, production uses a separate branch
